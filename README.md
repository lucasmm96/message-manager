# Message Manager

As part of my web learning journey, this is an open-source application developed to store citations, any art created for the message, and plan their publication on social networks.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
